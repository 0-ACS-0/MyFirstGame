    {\Huge \textbf{Abstract}}
\end{center}
This is the plot of a simple and ordinary game, made just for learning purposes. It will be subdivided into chapters, so the development of the game becomes easier and clearer when reading it after a long time. \par

The idea of the plot is to represent a normal situation, in a normal place, with normal dialogues and a bit of spicy hidden messages. \par

Also, because the interface will be extremely simple, the plot will be adjusted to the gameplay so it would be even simpler than any of my other amateur histories. But I'll do my best! \par

Hope I have the strength of ending a project... \par
Wish me luck!
